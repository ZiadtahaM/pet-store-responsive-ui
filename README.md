![A screenshot of the Paws'n Play website](websitepic.png)

This project is a fully responsive landing page for a fictional pet store, "Paws'n Play." It was built from scratch using only **HTML5** and **CSS3**, with a focus on modern, clean design and advanced CSS techniques.

The primary goal was to create a visually appealing and functional user interface that showcases a deep understanding of responsive design, CSS Flexbox, and advanced selectors without relying on any CSS frameworks or JavaScript.
